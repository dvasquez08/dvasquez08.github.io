            Hello, my name is David Vasquez. I have an IT background in network
            and server administration and have recently been doing app
            development and cloud administration. I am a problem solver and
            enjoy learning new skills. I love coding because it brings
            creativeness and problem solving together and I find it enjoyable.
            Trying out new things in tech is one of my favorite things to do. I
            hope you like what you see. By the way, check out my

          <h3>Student Attendance App</h3>
          <h4>Flutter | Firestore</h4>
          <p>
            An attendance app that uses the device's camera as a barcode
            scanner. The app scans the barcode, then sends the data to a
            Firestore database and also captures the timestamp of the scan to
            track attendance. The names were previously written down by hand.
            This app prevents human error and also disagreements between
            customers and staff when trying to confirm correct attendance times.
            This tracks that students attended as well as the timestamp of when
            they attended. Check out the code
            <a
              href="https://github.com/dvasquez08/flutter_attendance_app"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >.
          </p>

          /></span>
          <h3>Barcode QR Code Generator</h3>
          <h4>ReactJS | BootStrap</h4>
          <p>
            This app allows you to generate a barcode or a QR code using the
            data that you enter in the text box that is downloadable. After
            entering the data in the textbox, a barcode and a QR code will be
            generated in real-time as you type data in the box. Once your code
            is generated, you can download a PNG file to your phone or a local
            directory on your computer. This app was built with React, Vite and
            Bootstrap. You can try out this app by clicking
            <a
              href="https://dvasquez08.github.io/barcode-generator/"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >.

          <h3>Recipe Finder</h3>
          <h4>Dart | Flutter | Spoonacular API</h4>
          <p>
            This is a mobile app that I had a lot of fun working on. It is a
            recipe finder app that takes the ingredients that a user enters in,
            and shows what they can make with the ingredients they enter. The
            user enters what they have in the ingredients box, taps "Get Recipe"
            and then are taken to a page where it shows a list of dishes they
            can make. THe user can then make their selection and a dialog box
            appears with the recipe information such as cooking time,
            ingredients needed and the cooking instructions. All this data is
            pulled from the Spoonacular API that has the database of recipes.
            It's definitely been handy for me in a couple situations and helped
            me find some recipes in a pinch! Check out the info of this app
            <a
              href="https://github.com/dvasquez08/recipe-mobile-app"

          <h3>Happy YEG</h3>
          <h4>React JS | Tailwind CSS | Firebase</h4>
          <p>
            A handy little guide to helping people find the best Happy Hour
            specials in the city of Edmonton. This site was built with React and
            Tailwind CSS which was a lot of fun. The data was manually entered
            in a JSON file and the page reacts to the user's selection. If you
            click on North, West, etc, it will only show restaurants in the
            respective button that the user clicks on. Tailwind CSS really made
            it easy to make the site responsive so it looks great on desktop and
            mobile. There's a contact link in the menu where you can send me a
            message, and you're more than welcome to put in some suggestions!
            Feel free to try it out

          <h3>Locally Hosted AI Chatbot</h3>
          <h4>Ubuntu | Ollama | Docker</h4>
          <p>
            This was a very fun project to work on. This was a sub-section of
            home server project. My goal was to take an old computer and turn it
            into a home Ubuntu server, and see how far I can go with it without
            having to do any upgrades or change parts. One of the functions of
            this server was to host my own AI chatbot. Ollama was installed
            which was used to pull Llama3. Then, a web interface called Open Web
            UI was setup inside a Docker container, had it point to Ollama on
            the home server and lists the LLMs that were pulled. In this case,
            Llama3. The end result is a "ChatGPT" feel but with many features
            such as pulling different models, creating users and restrictions if
            necessary, and customizing AI models. I'm in the process of writing
            the docunentation which will be shared shortly on my Medium page.

          <p>
            Here is how it all started. At the age of 10 I built my first
            computer and what seemed like a daunting task at the time, turned
            into something that I found enjoyment in. I had fun learning about
            the computer, which evolved into working with networks of computers
            and servers as I got older (maybe not as fun some days &#128522;),
            and I never wanted to stop learning. I learned things such as Linux
            and Cisco IOS and I still wanted to keep going. I was asked to make
            websites for friends which I didn't know how to do at the time, but
            I wanted to challenge myself and learn anyways. Started off with
            basic HTML, CSS, then React and would go on to build mobile apps for
            friends as well which was lots of fun! (yes, even the bugs). After
            all that I never want to stop learning and always want to continue
            learning new things, experimenting with my home lab, seeing what I
            can accomplish and pushing myself beyond any boundaries and my
            comfort zone. When things break, I see it as a learning opportunity
            which is a mindset that I have always lived by and has helped me
            propel my career forward.
